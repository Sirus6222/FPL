## Key Decisions (Agent 4)

1. **Daily matchday cadence**: Keeps engagement high during short tournaments
2. **Knockout multipliers**: Increases stakes without gambling mechanics
3. **XP/Coins cross-mode**: Tournament earnings benefit main profile
4. **African pride focus**: Inclusive messaging regardless of Ethiopia's participation
5. **Bridge content**: Explicit funnel from tournament to EPL mode

## Assumptions

- Player data available from official tournament sources or third-party APIs
- Tournament schedule confirmed 2+ weeks in advance
- Minimum 5,000 users active for tournament mode to justify ops investment

## Open Questions

1. Should tournament mode have separate leaderboards or integrated with EPL?
2. What's the minimum prize budget per tournament?
3. How to handle mid-tournament player injuries/withdrawals?

## Key Decisions (Agent 6)

1. **Tiered sponsorship**: Clear packages for different budget levels
2. **Privacy-first data**: No individual data sold, only aggregates
3. **Survey caps**: Prevent user fatigue (3/week max)
4. **Transparent consent**: Clear language, easy opt-out
5. **Showroom integration**: Physical venues as sponsorship assets

## Assumptions

- Ethiopian businesses willing to sponsor digital platforms
- Users accept survey-for-coins as fair value exchange
- Regulatory environment remains permissive for aggregated data

## Open Questions

1. Should data products require user opt-in or opt-out?
2. What's the right balance of coin reward vs survey length?
3. How to verify sponsor payment before launching campaign?

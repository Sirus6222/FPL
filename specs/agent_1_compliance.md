## 2. Mechanics Audit Checklist

### ⚠️ Patterns That Trigger "Betting" Classification

| Pattern | Risk Level | Our Approach | Status |
|---------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Pooled user funds → winner takes pot | 🔴 HIGH | Prizes guaranteed by platform/sponsor | ✅ AVOIDED |
| User vs House mechanics | 🔴 HIGH | User vs User only; platform is neutral host | ✅ AVOIDED |
| Outcome based purely on chance | 🔴 HIGH | Multiple skill decisions: captain, transfers, formation | ✅ AVOIDED |
| Variable payout based on "odds" | 🔴 HIGH | Fixed prize tiers per contest | ✅ AVOIDED |
| Real-money wagering on predictions | 🔴 HIGH | Virtual coins for entry; prizes are rewards | ✅ AVOIDED |
| No skill differentiation | 🟡 MEDIUM | Leaderboard ranking by points (skill-based) | ✅ AVOIDED |
| Instant gratification mechanics | 🟡 MEDIUM | Season-long + weekly contests require sustained play | ✅ AVOIDED |
| Withdrawal before contest ends | 🟡 MEDIUM | No mid-contest cash-out; prizes at conclusion | ✅ AVOIDED |

### ✅ Required Compliance Behaviors

- [ ] All prizes must be pre-announced and guaranteed before contest starts
- [ ] Entry fees collected go to platform; prizes come from platform/sponsor budget
- [ ] No percentage of entry fees directly forms the prize
- [ ] Leaderboard rankings determine winners (skill-based)
- [ ] Multiple decision points per contest (captain, bench, transfers, chips)
- [ ] Platform takes transparent fee (not hidden "house edge")
- [ ] Terms of Service explicitly state "Game of Skill"

## 3. Skill-Based Justification Map

| Feature | Skill Signal | Evidence |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Captain Selection** | Strategic decision | 2x points multiplier requires analysis of fixtures, form, opponent |
| **Vice-Captain** | Contingency planning | Backup strategy for captain rotation |
| **Transfer Market** | Resource management | Budget allocation, price prediction, form analysis |
| **Formation Choice** | Tactical decision | 4-4-2 vs 3-5-2 based on fixture difficulty |
| **Chip Activation** | Timing strategy | Wildcard, Bench Boost, Triple Captain require GW analysis |
| **Bench Order** | Priority judgment | Auto-sub order impacts points if starter doesn't play |
| **Fixture Analysis** | Research & analytics | DGW/BGW planning, opponent strength assessment |
| **Price Change Tracking** | Market intelligence | Buy before rises, sell before drops |
| **Player Statistics** | Data-driven decisions | xG, xA, clean sheet probability inform picks |
| **League Strategy** | Competitive positioning | Differential picks vs template for mini-league advantage |

### Skill Intensity Score: 9/10
*Multiple independent skill decisions per gameweek; sustained engagement over 38 weeks; performance correlates with research and strategy.*

## 4. Compliant Contest Model Specification

### Contest Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    CONTEST FLOW                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Platform announces contest with GUARANTEED prizes       │
│  2. Users enter using Coins (virtual currency)              │
│  3. Coins purchased via Telebirr/Chapa (real money)         │
│  4. All entries compete on skill-based leaderboard          │
│  5. Rankings determined by FPL points (objective scoring)   │
│  6. Prizes awarded to top performers from platform budget   │
│  7. Platform retains entry fees as service revenue          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Financial Flow (Compliant)

```
User → Coins Purchase (50 Birr) → Platform Revenue
                ↓
Platform Budget → Guaranteed Prizes → Top Performers
                ↓
        (NOT: Entry Fees → Prize Pool → Winners)
```

### Contest Types

| Contest Type | Entry (Coins) | Prize Source | Prize Examples |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Free Contest | 0 | Platform/Sponsor | XP, Cosmetics, Status |
| Micro Contest | 50-100 | Platform Budget | 200-500 Coins, Items |
| Standard Contest | 200-500 | Platform + Sponsor | 1000+ Coins, Merch |
| Premium Contest | 1000+ | Major Sponsor | Jerseys, Vouchers, Electronics |

### Platform Fee Logic

- Platform retains 100% of entry fees as service revenue
- Prizes are a marketing/operational expense, not a redistribution
- Fee is transparent: "Entry: 100 Coins | Prize: 500 Coins to Top 10"
- No "rake" or "house edge" terminology

## 5. UI Microcopy Guidelines

### Contest Screens

| Element | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Contest Title | "Win Big Cash!" | "Weekly Manager Challenge" |
| Entry CTA | "Place Your Bet" | "Enter Contest" |
| Prize Display | "Jackpot: 10,000 Birr" | "Guaranteed Prize: 10,000 Birr" |
| Winner Announcement | "You Won!" | "You Earned Top Rank!" |
| Entry Fee | "Stake 50 Birr" | "Entry: 50 Coins" |

### Reward Screens

| Element | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Prize Claim | "Collect Your Winnings" | "Claim Your Reward" |
| Bonus | "Lucky Bonus" | "Achievement Bonus" |
| Streak | "Lucky Streak" | "Login Streak Reward" |

### Legal/Informational

```
REQUIRED DISCLAIMER (Footer on contest screens):
"This is a Game of Skill. Prizes are guaranteed by [Platform/Sponsor Name]
and are not funded by pooled entry fees. Performance is based on your
strategic decisions as a fantasy football manager."
```

### Compliant CTAs

- "Compete Now" ✅
- "Join the Challenge" ✅
- "Prove Your Skills" ✅
- "Enter for [X] Coins" ✅
- "See Guaranteed Prizes" ✅

## Key Decisions

1. **Dual Currency**: Coins (virtual) for entries; Birr only for coin purchases
2. **Prize Guarantee**: All prizes pre-funded by platform/sponsor
3. **No Pooling**: Entry fees ≠ prize money (different budget lines)
4. **Skill Emphasis**: Every screen emphasizes strategic decisions
5. **Transparent Fees**: Platform fee is service charge, not hidden edge

## Assumptions

- Ethiopian regulatory environment does not have specific fantasy sports legislation
- Skill-based games are not classified as gambling if chance is not dominant factor
- Platform operates under general business/entertainment regulations

## Open Questions

1. Do we need legal counsel sign-off before launch?
2. Are there age restrictions (18+) for coin purchases?
3. Should we implement spending limits per user per month?
